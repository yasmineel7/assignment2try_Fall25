# 🏃‍♂️ Marathon Simulator – JavaFX MVC Application
Students are encouraged to explore additional features and demonstrate strong problem-solving skills as well as effective GUI design.
## What to Do

Implement an **MVC-based JavaFX GUI application** for a **Marathon Simulator** that simulates a marathon race.

## Application Requirements

### 1. Display a Slideshow of Marathoners

- The application should begin by displaying a **slideshow of 4 to 5 marathoners** along with a **greeting message**.
- Use **JavaFX multimedia features** such as playing a **sound file** during the slideshow.
- Each marathoner should have a **unique identity and appearance** (name, number, color, etc.).
- For this purpose, you can **design and draw** the marathoners  of your choice using tools such as Photoshop, Paint, or any drawing application,  as illustrated in the figure below.

- The slideshow should:

  - Display **one marathoner’s picture at a time**.
  - Have a **reasonable delay** between images.
  - Automatically display the **next marathoner’s picture** after the delay.

### 2. Display the Marathon Simulation

After the slideshow, the **marathon simulation** should start.

- The UI should include a layout similar to the example provided (a race track, marathoners, and control buttons).
- Use the **Transition class** in JavaFX to animate each marathoner’s movement from the **start line** to the **finish line**.
- Each marathoner’s animation should simulate motion by changing shape attributes (e.g., position) over time.
- The **winner** is the first marathoner to cross the finish line.

When the race ends:

- Display an **appropriate message** announcing the winner(s).
- Update the **message area** (bottom right) with relevant information, such as:
  - Greeting messages
  - Race results
  - Types of animations demonstrated
  - Layout or interface details
  - ![Marathon Graph](images/Marathon.png)


### 3. Control Buttons

In the **bottom-left area**, provide control buttons for managing the simulation:

| Button    | Description                                 |

| **Start** | Starts or resumes the marathon simulation.  |

| **Pause** | Pauses the ongoing simulation. |

| **Exit**  | Closes the application. |

You may add additional buttons or controls as needed.

##  MVC Architecture Requirements

Implement the application using the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** pattern:

### **Model – MarathonerModel**

- Stores data and attributes for each marathoner, such as:
  - Name
  - Number
  - Coordinates (x, y)
  - Speed
  - Color
- Provides methods for updating state and position.

### **Controller – MarathonController**

- Manages the **simulation logic**.
- Handles actions such as:
  - Starting and stopping the race
  - Updating marathoner positions
  - Determining and displaying the winner(s)

### **View – MarathonerFXML (or equivalent JavaFX View class)**

- Responsible for the **graphical user interface** and **visual representation**.
- Displays:
  - The slideshow
  - The race simulation
  - Messages (greeting, race results, animations, layout info, etc.)
